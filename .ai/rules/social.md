## GBP JPEG must outlive PROCESSING
Google fetches Local Post sourceUrl after create while LocalPostState is Processing/Scheduled/Unspecified. Keep the JPEG derivative on disk until reconcile settle() or RecoverStuckPosts fails the 24h review. Deleting in publish() finally races PHOTO_FETCH_FAILED. Live/Rejected on the create response may prune immediately. Path is deterministic: google-business-derivatives/{postPlatformId}.jpg. Wire values live on App\Enums\GoogleBusiness\LocalPostState — never compare raw PROCESSING/SCHEDULED strings. DeletePost must prune every Google Business PostPlatform JPEG before $post->delete() — a user delete during pending_review would otherwise leak the file, and a DB cascade on post_platforms does not fire Eloquent observers.
